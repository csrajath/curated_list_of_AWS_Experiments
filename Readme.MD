# AWS Hands-On Experiments
This repository contains a list of possible experiments one can perform in order to gain hands on experience with AWS.

This repository is certainly useful for those planning a AWS Certification.

The projects can include(not limited to): 
 - pipe line environments
 - frameworks
 - products

# Repo Structure
For now, I do not aim at maintaining a particular directory structure, but going forward I shall surely organize it according to the services offered by AWS.

# Can I contribute?
Of course! I will be surprised to see a notification saying User {xyz} created a Pull Request. 
I promise to approve the PR first, and only then review it.
Users/Developers/DevOps engineers can contribute to this repository by picking up the idea of experiment described and building an aws equivalent model to it.

## AWS Fun Activity
AWs has a youtube playlist named [AWS Knowledge Center Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhr1KZpdzukfdjsOHZ-BazZt1iK1J8UUw) and [This is my Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwxhclKcMas&list=PLhr1KZpdzukdeX8mQ2qO73bg6UKQHYsHb), using both of which I plan on to develop an automation process in which a bot automatically pics up the possible list of videos and convert it into a project directory here. Any contributions to the same are much appreciated.
